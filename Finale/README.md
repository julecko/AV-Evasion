So, this is not a method, this is series of method, all in one. Throughout entire repository, all methods in one file to see, how much can we go from being detected by 32 antiviruses. I recommend watch other repositories first. When creating this file, i saw that some methods actually trigger antivirus, so i didnt include some methods. I removed methods `Static evasion` and `Message to the unknown`, because in combination with other methods they increased number of antiviruses. There are some basic antiviruses, which are avoided with most simpliest evasion techniques but better antiviruses can actually trigger more because of theese methods. To implement static evasion i would suggest downloading payload from website as image. As image, because image can be random, can contain random data as numbers but text, html wont, and transfering whole binary can trigger antivirus behavioral shield. After many atempts, i got 8 out of 73 antiviruses and last step was, to add check, if debugger is present and suprisingly, 1 antivirus dropped down because of this. So in the end, using the simpliest methods i could get program from 32 antiviruses down to 27 by encrypting payload and then from 27 to just 7 using techniques to avoid dynamic analysis. Thoose 7 are antiviruses, i havent even heard of, so in case of real program use, you should be alright. And you should not forget to code always with ethical intentions, or dont.
