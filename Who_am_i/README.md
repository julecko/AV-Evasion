# Who am I
After seeing title of this method, some of you might have tought about command on linux whoami but theese 2 dont have much in common. In this case program simply checks if it has name which it should have. Antiviruses when putting program into sandbox, usually dont transfer it with same name, its usually another name, maybe serial number, i dont know this one exactly, but its not the same name.
## Statistics
In an encrypted payload we can see drop of 13 from 27 to 14 antiviruses which is very close to one of the best methods. In normal payload, still not a big change but again, thats because there is static analysis flagging it as malicious.
## Results
